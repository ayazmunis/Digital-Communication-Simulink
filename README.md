# Digital-Communication-Modulation-Demodulation-Modelling-Simulink

## Description
This project focuses on implementing and simulating Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK), Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) and 16-Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (16-QAM) systems using Simulink. The aim is to demonstrate the functionality and performance of these modulation schemes in digital communication, particularly in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN).

## Key Features
- **Modulation Schemes Implementation:** Utilized Simulink to design and implement BPSK and 16-QAM modulation schemes. Each modulation scheme was developed as a separate Simulink model, incorporating necessary signal processing blocks.
   
- **AWGN Channel Simulation:** Simulated signal transmission over AWGN channels using Simulink to mimic real-world communication environments. This enables assessment of system performance under noisy conditions.

- **Performance Analysis:** Conducted performance analysis by evaluating bit error rate (BER) of transmitted signals under varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). Theoretical and simulated BER curves were generated for comparison.

## BPSK
- **Scatter Plots** 

- **BERvsSNR Curve** 

## Future Enhancements
- Integration of additional modulation schemes and channel models for exploring a wider range of communication scenarios.
- Implementation of advanced signal processing techniques such as error correction coding and channel equalization.
- Development of a graphical user interface (GUI) for interactive exploration and analysis.

## Dependencies
- MATLAB and Simulink
- Signal Processing Toolbox
